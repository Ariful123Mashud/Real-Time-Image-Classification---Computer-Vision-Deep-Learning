ðŸš˜Advancing Driver Assistance with Real-Time Image Classification

Excited to share one of my recent projects where I implemented real-time image classification as a foundational block for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS).

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack:

OpenCV for real-time video capture and processing

TensorFlow / Keras (MobileNetV2) for lightweight, efficient deep learning inference

Python for seamless integration

ðŸ”¹ Highlights:

Built a real-time pipeline to capture frames from a camera and classify road objects (vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs).

Optimized the model for low-latency inference to ensure safety-critical responsiveness.

Designed with scalability in mind, so it can be extended towards lane detection, collision avoidance, and driver monitoring systems.

This project reinforces how computer vision + deep learning are driving innovations in mobility, making roads safer and smarter.

ðŸ’¡ Next step: Integrating this with control systems for decision-making in autonomous driving research.
